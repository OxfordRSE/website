We have distributed a short survey (2-3 mins) that aims to evaluate the
landscape of research software development within the University of Oxford. 

This will enable us to assess the need for a RSE support group within the
university, and what software skills are most needed across the four academic
divisions: Humanities, MPLS, Medical Sciences & Social Sciences.

If you are an academic staff member or DPhil student within University of
Oxford and are interested in research software development support, please
email us at <rse@cs.ox.ac.uk> for a link to the survey.
