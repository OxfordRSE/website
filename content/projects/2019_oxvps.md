A large number of stroke patients - up to almost 80% - suffer for visual impairments after stroke: neglecting objects on one side, visual hallucinations, difficulties recognising faces or objects, impaired motion perception, etc. However, only 20% of patients and carers self-report these impairments. Systematic screening is therefore essential, but the current assessment methods are slow, resulting in increased time pressure on NHS staff. The current lack of experts in neuropsychology also means that reliability of assessment could be improved.
     
The OxVPS project is led by [Dr Kathleen Vancleef](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/kathleen-vancleef) from the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/) at the University of Oxford. It aims at standardising the administration of assessments, as well as leveraging new technologies to reduce human errors and save precious time through automated scoring and reporting. At the core of the project is the development of a mobile screening application suitable for stroke patients in Acute Stroke Units. This app is based on a previously developed paper-based screening tool.
     
## OxRSE involvement

OxRSE was involved from the very early stages of the OxVPS project. Fergus Cooper, Mihaela Duta and Thibault Lestang provided both the software expertise and development work to turn the paper-based assessment into a full-blown mobile app, usable by clinicians with very limited time and suitable for stroke patients with impairments such as neglecting objects on one side or difficulties recognising objects.
     
We also worked closely with Dr Kathleen Van Cleef and Federica Guazzo to implement an automatic scoring system, as well as the gathering of test data necessary to validate the application-based assessment against trusted paper-based visual perception tests.
