## The ECO Retrofit project

The problem of under-performance in buildings retrofit related to the skills and knowledge gap in low energy construction is widely recognised. It is vital to address this if we are to achieve the policy objective of 80% carbon emissions reduction in the UK's housing stock by 2050. Approximately 28 out of 30m buildings in the UK need to be retrofitted by the end of 2050, an estimated 10,000 deep home retrofits per week, to meet reduction targets. Despite the huge opportunities this may create for the construction industry and the technical potential, technology alone is still insufficient, either in quantity or quality, to meet these goals and there are significant risks of unintended consequences from actions carried out in ignorance or with lack of care.

## Oxford RSE involvement

The RSE group were involved in the project at the request of Drs. Marina Topouzi and Gavin Killip of the ECI to collaborate on designing a mobile app to support management of the risks involved in buildings retrofit projects. Using an agile approach with iterative, incremental delivery, we designed a tablet app to navigate and display relevant project risks. We worked with the researchers, stakeholders from the construction industry and relevant standards bodies to elicit feedback on the app's development and the experience of using it.

The team developed a cross-platform tablet app for both Android and iOS, demonstrating it to the project team and inviting feedback and reprioritisation every two weeks. We also collaborated with Oxford University Innovations to create a business plan for commercialising the app. The outcome, at March 2020, is a "beta version" of the retrofit app that demonstrates the feasibility and usability of the app. The experience gained in this project will be used in building a final app for general release by the same team.
