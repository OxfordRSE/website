{{< figure src="/images/uniq_plus_logo.png" title="UNIQ+ research internships  are designed to introduce students from under-represented backgrounds to graduate study and offer everyone who takes part tangible benefits in terms of confidence, skills and experience that will enhance both their CV and any future postgraduate applications.">}}


OxRSE is delighted to be a part of the
[UNIQ+ research internships](https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/access/uniq-plus 
). OxRSE assisted the first UNIQ+ cohort in in 2019 by providing 
two weeks of software engineering courses for the students. In 2021, we will again be 
providing courses in software engineering as well as supervision for the 4-week 
research projects that each intern undertakes during their time at Oxford.
