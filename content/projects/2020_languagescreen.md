LanguageScreen (<https://languagescreen.com>) is an application comprising
a Android app and a website that gives education professionals a quick and
accurate assessment of a child's English oral language skills. Oral language
skills are critical for development and provide the foundation for literacy
skills and formal education. Automated language screening can inform
intervention methods, while being reliable, valid and easy to administer. The
test, which is scored automatically, is given in form of a series of questions
in expressive vocabulary, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary,
sentence repetition and pseudo-word repetition. Automatically generated reports
can be downloaded from a secure website. This is intended to be used with
children 3--8 years of age.

The LanguageScreen project is based at the Department of Education, led by
[Prof. Charles Hulme](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/charles-hulme/)
and [Prof. Maggie Snowling](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/people/professor-maggie-snowling/) (Department of Experimental Psychology), along with
[Dr. Gillian West](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/gillian-west/),
[Dr. Mihaela Duta](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/mihaela-duta),
[Susan Scrimgeour](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/susan-scrimgeour/),

## Oxford RSE involvement

The OxRSE group started working on the project in July 2019 to develop a secure
website to accompany the existing Android application. The website would store
results from the accompanying Android app which was developed by Dr. Mihaela
Duta. In doing so, the website would support school administrators and the
LanguageScreen research group in enabling the large-scale data collection
required by the project. Alongside data collection, the website automatically
generates assessment reports by school and class which can be downloaded by
school administrators. The Android app was also updated to support reading QR
codes generated by the website to facilitate data entry for schools.
A successful proof-of-concept of the website was completed by November 2019,
with several improvements in functionality since then.

Following launch of the website, there was a successful trial of the new data
collection process...
