{{< language-screen >}} gives education professionals a quick and accurate assessment of a child's oral language skills which provide the foundation for the development of literacy skills and formal education more broadly. Automated language screening can provide a way of indentifying children who would benefit from language intervention. {{< language-screen >}}  has been shown to be reliable, valid and easy to administer.

{{< language-screen >}} is intended to be used with children 3--8 years of age. There are four subtests: expressive vocabulary, listening comprehension, receptive vocabulary, and sentence repetition. Automatically generated reports can be downloaded from the secure website.

The {{< language-screen >}}>  project is based at the [Department of Education](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk) and is led by
[Prof. Charles Hulme](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/charles-hulme/)
and [Prof. Maggie Snowling](https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/people/professor-maggie-snowling/) ([Department of Experimental Psychology](http://www.psy.ox.ac.uk)), along with
[Dr. Gillian West](http://www.education.ox.ac.uk/people/gillian-west/),
[Dr. Mihaela Duta](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/mihaela-duta),

## Oxford RSE involvement

The OxRSE group started working on this project in July 2019 to develop the [**secure
website**](<https://languagescreen.com>) to store and process the results from the accompanying {{< language-screen >}} Android app developed by Dr. Mihaela Duta

{{< youtube wpWcLdmD5KM >}}

The secure website supports school administrators who want to use the test and the {{< language-screen >}}  research group in enabling the large-scale data collection. Alongside data collection, the website automatically generates assessment reports by school and class which can be downloaded by school administrators. The Android app was also updated to support reading QR codes generated by the website to facilitate data entry for schools.

A successful proof-of-concept of the website was completed by November 2019, with several improvements in functionality since then. Following the launch of the website, there was a successful trial of the new data collection process started in December 2019.
