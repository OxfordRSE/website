# The EPSRC Sustainable Approaches to Biomedical Science: Responsible & Reproducible Research (SABS R³) 

The [SABS R³](https://www.sabsr3.ox.ac.uk/) Center for Doctoral Training (CDT), is 
unique in that as well as training doctoral students in systems approaches to biomedical 
research, it also teaches advanced software engineering practices. Computational methods 
are central to biomedical reserach, and well-engineered software has already proved 
capable of transforming biomedical science, from simulations of complex biological 
systems, sophisticated high-througput image analysis, and the analysis of large scale 
datasets. The goal of SABS R3 CDT is to enable a transformation of research culture, by 
training the next generation of computational biomedical researchers that can also 
utilise best practices in software development for the production of reproducable, 
sustainable software tools to support biomedical science.

# OxRSE Involvment in SABS R³

[Martin Robinson](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/) is a co-director of the SABS DTC, 
and he, [Fergus Cooper](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/) and [Graham 
Lee](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/), along with collaborators from the [Software 
Sustainability Institute (SSI)](https://www.software.ac.uk/) have helped to develop and 
deliver the Software Engineering and Scientific Computing teaching modules for SABS. We 
also help to mentor and supervise the SABS students on their group-based, year-long 
open-source software projects.
