Oxford Research Software Engineering enables academics to work with professional software developers who specialise in translational research and research projects aiming for commercialisation. We can help with:

 - Defining, scoping and costing software effort in grant proposals;
 - Delivering high-quality software to enable research outputs;
 - Training your group in software engineering best practice;
 - Helping you and your spin-out commercialise your research software.
