We are a team based in the [Department of Computer
Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) exploring the need for research software
engineering (RSE) support within the [University of
Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). The aim of this support group would be to
provide researchers with the ability to hire professional software developers
when they are needed: for any period from a few days to a few years.

You can find more information about us and our project aims in the [About]({{<
ref "about.md" >}}) page.

For more information about the research software community within the UK,
please see either the [Software Sustainability
Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) or the [UK Research Software Engineers
Association](http://rse.ac.uk).

If you have any questions, please do get in touch at <rse@cs.ox.ac.uk>
