# Research Software Engineering

We are a team based in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) exploring the need for research software engineering (RSE) support within the [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/).
Our aim is to establish a group that would allow researchers the ability to hire professional software developers from a central Oxford pool as and when they are needed: for any period from a few days to a few years.

You can find more information about us and our project aims in the [About]({{<ref "about.md" >}}) page.

For more information about the research software community within the UK, please see the [Software Sustainability
Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk) and the [UK Research Software Engineers Association](http://rse.ac.uk).

Check out our [posts]({{<ref "posts.md" >}}) for our latest news and tech blog.

If you have any questions, please do get in touch at <rse@cs.ox.ac.uk>.
