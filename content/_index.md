The Oxford Research Software Engineering group is based in the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/).
We address the need for professional software engineering expertise within the University of Oxford and for external collaborators.

Our group enables academics to work with professional software developers who specialise in translational research and research projects aiming for commercialisation.

If you are interested in collaborating with us on your project, please fill in [this short form](https://goo.gl/forms/Ten4EsxZSOUIwJLD3):
