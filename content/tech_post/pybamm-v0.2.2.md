[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org/) is a Python battery modelling software developed in a 
collaboration between Oxford academics in the [Mathematical 
Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), the OxRSE group and the [Faraday 
Institution](https://faraday.ac.uk/). We are happy to report that V0.2.2 of PyBaMM
has just been released, see the website for [details](https://www.pybamm.org/news). Also 
on the website are videos from last three PyBaMM online workshops. 

[PyBaMM](https://www.pybamm.org/) can be used for solving specific battery models as 
well as arbitrary [PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation), 
[ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation) or 
[DAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential-algebraic_system_of_equations) models 
specified by the user. If you are at all interested in numerical modelling then check 
out the latest version of PyBaMM, now on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pybamm/) thanks 
to our own [Thibault Lestang](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people/).
