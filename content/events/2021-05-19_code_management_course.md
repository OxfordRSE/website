19 May 2021 ~ Remote (Teams) ~ [Sign-up on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/code-management-with-git-and-github-tickets-154797981931)


The Oxford Research Software Engineering group is running a free half day course on code management for graduate students and researchers at the University of Oxford.


## Overview

This course will give you a practical introduction to software engineering best practices in code management, software sustainability, reproducible software and open software publishing.

Topics include:

 - Distributed version control
 - Git
 - GitHub
 - Branches and merging
 - Citing software

## Audience

The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers who want to learn more about managing their research code in a reproducible fashion. No programming experience is expected, but some comfort with the Unix shell would be beneficial.


## Where

Remote. We will use Teams, and a link will be sent to course participants shortly before the course. Please use your `.ox.ac.uk` address [when signing up here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/code-management-with-git-and-github-tickets-154797981931) so that you can be added to the team. This class is only open to University members, so if you don't use your University email address you may not be able to attend!


## When

Wednesday 19th May, 14:00-17:00.

## Prerequisites

You should install the [git source code management tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and sign up for a free account with [github](https://github.com), _before_ the course starts.
