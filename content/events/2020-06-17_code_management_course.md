 - Git
 - GitHub
 - Branches and merging
 - Citing software

**Audience**: The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers who want to learn more about managing their research code in a reproducible fashion. No programming experience is expected, but some comfort with the Unix shell would be beneficial.
