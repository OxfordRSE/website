- *Is your work a collection of loosely organised python scripts?*
- *Is copy/paste your tool of choice when reusing some of your previous work?*
- *Would you like to make it possible to "pip install" your code instead of emailing it to your colleagues?*

With one or more "yes", you should join the next OxRSE free course on python
packaging!

**Efficiently organise and share your python projects with python packages**

- **When**: March 24th 2021 - 14:00-17:00
- **Where**: Online

## Description

During the exploratory phases of a research work, it is very convenient to just jot down a few
lines of code to wrangle, analyse or visualise data.  However, this approach quickly
leads to a collection of scripts that is difficult to maintain, reuse and share with
others.

In this workshop you will learn how to turn a couple of python scripts into a full blown
Python package. You will see how you can develop and maintain this package independently
from your data and reuse it across different analyses. Along the way, you will learn
about virtual environments, which allow to isolate a project's configuration and keep
your Python setup clean and reproducible. Finally, you will learn the simple steps to
make it possible for anyone to "pip install" your package, automatically installing the
required dependencies.


## Contents

1. Making a python package from a collection of python scripts
2. Reusing package(s) across research projects
3. Python virtual environments
4. Sharing your package with the world
5. Overview of advanced topics
  
## Requirements

- Only a basic knowledge of Python is required.
- Participants are expected to have basic familiarity with the command line, whether they are using Windows, MacOS or GNU/Linux.
- All experience levels are welcome, from graduate student to senior professor.
