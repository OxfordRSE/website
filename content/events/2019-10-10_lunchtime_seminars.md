The Oxford Research Software Engineering (OxRSE) group (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/RSE/), with the Research Software Developers Network (RSDN) is organising a series of monthly lunch-time seminars starting this month, on the 10th October, 12:30 - 13:30.

Please join us in Lecture Theatre B in the Department of Computer Science, Wolfson building. Lunch will be provided, and to give us an idea of numbers please sign up via this form.

This month we will have two speakers:

**Martin Robinson** (OxRSE group head)
Martin will give an introduction to the newly formed Oxford Research Software Engineering group, covering what we do, and some of the projects we have been working on over the past year, and the plan for the future.

**Ian Bush** (EPSRC Research Software Engineer Fellow)
Over the last decade or so there has been an increasing realisation nationally of the importance of software as part of the research process, and as a result the import of the people who write it. This has resulted in the recognition of a whole new role, the Research Software Engineer. In this talk I shall re-live a bit of history, talk a bit about where we are today, and comment on a few challenges we face, both nationally and at Oxford.

# Where
