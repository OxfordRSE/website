20 January 2021 ~ Remote (Zoom) ~ Sign-up on Eventbrite coming soon


The Oxford Research Software Engineering group is running a free half day course on code management for graduate students and researchers at the University of Oxford.


## Overview

This course will give you a practical introduction to software engineering best practices in code management, software sustainability, reproducible software and open software publishing.

Topics include:

 - Distributed version control
 - Git
 - GitHub
 - Branches and merging
 - Citing software

## Audience

The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers who want to learn more about managing their research code in a reproducible fashion. No programming experience is expected, but some comfort with the Unix shell would be beneficial.


## Where

Remote. We will use Zoom, and a link will be sent to course participants shortly before the course.


## When

Wednesday 20th January, 14:00-17:00.

## Prerequisites

You should install the [git source code management tool](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and sign up for a free account with [github](https://github.com), _before_ the course starts.
