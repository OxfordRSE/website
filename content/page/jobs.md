The OxRSE group currently has multiple open positions for
Research Software Engineers (RSE). This is an exciting opportunity to join a
growing team and work as an RSE on a diverse selection of world-leading and
impactful projects. We offer RSEs the potential to advance their career and to
make a significant contribution to the development of good software practices at
a world-leading university. 

These posts are offered as open-ended positions. They are full time roles, but
flexible options will be considered (e.g. part-time, job share). We are also
open to remote work options within the UK.

You will work on a variety of world-class research projects across the University of
Oxford, deliver workshops and training in software development best practices,
and further develop your own technical and research skills as well as those
outside of software development, such as project management and consultancy.

We are looking for candidates with significant experience in software
development within a research environment (a doctoral degree is preferred, but
equivalent experience will also be considered) and who have a demonstrated
ability to design, implement and deploy a complex software engineering project,
both individually and as part of a team. You must be able to collaborate effectively
with other researchers and have a deep understanding of software engineering
best practices (design, testing, documentation, reproducibility etc.) and how to
apply these effectively and to champion their use within a research environment.

For more details please see the [Job Description](0018702339.pdf). Applications
can be made by emailing [Martin Robinson](mailto:martin.robinson@dtc.ox.ac.uk)
with a CV and a supporting statement that explains how you meet each of the
selection criteria for the post using examples of your skills and experience.
