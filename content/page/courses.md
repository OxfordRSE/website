The Oxford RSE group offers regular training courses in a variety of topics in research 
software engineering. These courses are free for University of Oxford researchers and 
graduate students, but paid places are available for those external to the university. 

**How to Book:** Our [events page](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/events/) lists upcoming 
scheduled courses where you can book your place. 

**Scheduling additional courses**: If you are interested in holding one of these 
training courses for your research group or department then we can organise additional 
courses on a paid basis, please contact us on <rse@cs.ox.ac.uk>. 

**Bespoke courses**: We are always interested in developing new courses as well, so 
please get in contact if there are any other software engineering topics you think would 
be useful for your research group or the
wider university. We can develop bespoke courses by costing in an appropriate amount of
RSE time, please see our [About](/about/) page for more details.

*Due to the ongoing COVID-19 restrictions, all courses are being held remotely via Zoom 
or MS Teams.*
