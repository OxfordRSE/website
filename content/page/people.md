Fergus Cooper did his DPhil in the [Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-biology).

Fergus's research focusses on the development of computational tools which he applies to the understanding of biological processes in epithelial development.
Through the development of computational modelling tools he has become interested in, and an advocate for, software best practices within academia.

Fergus is a leading developer on the [Chaste project](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/), contributes to a number of other projects including [Trase](https://github.com/trase-cpp/trase), and has a particular interest in the C++ programming language.

![Personal photo - Mihaela Duta](photo_mihaela_duta.jpg "Mihaela Duta")\

Mihaela Duta is a Research Associate in the [Oxford University Babylab](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-babylab) within the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/). Her current research focus is on neuro-computational models for language-mediated attention in infancy.

Mihaela has a long-standing active interest in research software engineering. From 2012 to 2018 she held the role of Research Software Officer in the Department of Experimental Psychology, during which time she provided sustainable software infrastructure for a wide variety of neuropsychology research projects. She specialises in translational interdisciplinary research involving the design, development and deployment of tablet-based tools for cognitive assessment. Apps assessing language development in children, attention and executive function in adolescents and young adults, and cognitive impairment related to old age or trauma have been deployed in schools, population surveillance centres and clinics in the UK, Europe, Africa and South America.

Mihaela's current research interests include machine learning, signal processing, language development  and research methods. She has been a member of the committee for the UK community of the Research Software Engineers since 2016.
