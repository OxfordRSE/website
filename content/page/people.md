David Gavaghan is Professor of Computational Biology in the Department of Computer Science.
His research is interdisciplinary and involves the application of mathematical and computational techniques to problems in the biomedical sciences.

He has a long-standing interest in computational science, and in the development of open source software tools and of computational infrastructures to support the research scientist.

David currently serves on the advisory board of the Software Sustainability Institute (SSI).

Andy is responsible for developing Oxford’s industrial links in the energy sector: anything from finding fossil fuels, through all forms of generating electricity, to how we distribute it, use it and indeed will pay for it.
Companies engaged include BP, Shell, Siemens, Continental and EDF, together with a range of smaller companies.

He has a particular interest in bringing together Oxford’s Professors to maximise Oxford’s contribution to a carbon-free world.
He helps companies find relevant research, facilitates in finding co-funded opportunities and liaises with careers office on student engagement.

As part of his role, he is bid to HEIF’s Connecting Capability Fund to develop Knowledge Exchange best practice in the use of 'IoT in commercial applications' (eg industry, health, energy and transport systems).
The bid is led by Sheffield, partnering Oxford, Newcastle and Cambridge.
Work of this project, funded by HEIF, will feed into a successful bid’s work programme.

Simon Hettrick is Deputy Director of the Software Sustainability Institute and co-Director of the Southampton Research Software Group.

At the Software Sustainability Institute, Simon is responsible for the Institute strategy, research and campaigning.
He works with stakeholders from across the research community to develop policies that support research software, the people who develop that software and the researchers who rely on it.
Simon's research focusses on the use of software in the research community with the aim of understanding practices and demographics.

Simon is a passionate advocate for Research Software Engineers.
He was the instigator of the Institute's RSE campaign and was the founding chair of the UK community of Research Software Engineers - and has been a committee member ever since.
He is the Principal Investigator of the RSE Network.

Fergus Cooper is a DPhil student in the [Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/mathematical-biology).

Fergus's research focusses on the development of computational tools which he applies to the understanding of biological processes in epithelial development.
Through the development of computational modelling tools he has become interested in, and an advocate for, software best practices within academia.

Fergus is a leading developer on the [Chaste project](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste/), and has a particular interest in the C++ programming language.
