## [Andy Gilchrist](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/our-team/andy-gilchrist)
![Personal photo - Andy Gilchrist](photo_andy_gilchrist.jpg "Andy Gilchrist")\

Andy is responsible for developing Oxford’s industrial links in the energy sector: anything from finding fossil fuels, through all forms of generating electricity, to how we distribute it, use it and indeed will pay for it.
Companies engaged include BP, Shell, Siemens, Continental and EDF, together with a range of smaller companies.

He has a particular interest in bringing together Oxford’s Professors to maximise Oxford’s contribution to a carbon-free world.
He helps companies find relevant research, facilitates in finding co-funded opportunities and liaises with careers office on student engagement.

As part of his role, he is bid to HEIF’s Connecting Capability Fund to develop Knowledge Exchange best practice in the use of 'IoT in commercial applications' (eg industry, health, energy and transport systems).
The bid is led by Sheffield, partnering Oxford, Newcastle and Cambridge.
Work of this project, funded by HEIF, will feed into a successful bid’s work programme.

Simon Hettrick is Deputy Director of the Software Sustainability Institute and co-Director of the Southampton Research Software Group.

At the Software Sustainability Institute, Simon is responsible for the Institute strategy, research and campaigning.
He works with stakeholders from across the research community to develop policies that support research software, the people who develop that software and the researchers who rely on it.
Simon's research focusses on the use of software in the research community with the aim of understanding practices and demographics.

Simon is a passionate advocate for Research Software Engineers.
He was the instigator of the Institute's RSE campaign and was the founding chair of the UK community of Research Software Engineers - and has been a committee member ever since.
He is the Principal Investigator of the RSE Network.

## [Mihaela Duta](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/team/mihaela-duta)
![Personal photo - Mihaela Duta](photo_mihaela_duta.jpg "Mihaela Duta")\

Mihaela Duta is a Research Associate in the [Oxford University Babylab](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/oxford-babylab) within the [Department of Experimental Psychology](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/). Her current research focus is on neuro-computational models for language-mediated attention in infancy.

Mihaela has a long-standing active interest in research software engineering. From 2012 to 2018 she held the role of Research Software Officer in the Department of Experimental Psychology, during which time she provided sustainable software infrastructure for a wide variety of neuropsychology research projects. She specialises in translational interdisciplinary research involving the design, development and deployment of tablet-based tools for cognitive assessment. Apps assessing language development in children, attention and executive funtion in adolescents and young adults, and cogntive impairment related to old age or trauma have been deployed in schools, population surveillance centres and clinics in the UK, Europe, Africa and South America.

Mihaela's current research interests include machine learning, signal processing, language development  and research methods. She has been a member of the committee for the UK community of the Research Software Engineers since 2016.
