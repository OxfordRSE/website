Ever wanted a fresh pair of eyes to look at your code, or to track down a bug? [The Oxford Code Review Network (OxCRN)](https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum) makes it easy for researchers at all levels, from students to senior professors, to engage in regular code reviews, both as reviewers and code authors.

Code reviews are **short** (one hour) and **informal** discussion over a short piece of code, involving its author and one or several reviewers.

Doing regular code reviews is truly effective way of making your research software better: not only free of bugs, but more importantly more readable, maintainable and extendable. Whatever your research field and level of experience, code reviews are opportunities to exchange with fellow researchers - possibly from different fields - and better your research software practice together.

**The Oxford Code Review Network** is centred around a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OxfordCodeReviewNet/forum) where researchers at the University of Oxford can easily both:
- Look for reviewers.
- Get in touch with other researchers looking for reviewers.


Participants in the network are encouraged to play both roles: sometimes reviewees, sometimes reviewers.
There is no required level of experience: the only thing you need to be a reviewer is a basic knowledge of the programming language (of which the code reviewed is written in).

The mission of OxCRN is to **foster a community of research software** in the University of Oxford, enabling the transfer of knowledge and software skills across researchers of various levels of experience and research communities. 

Your participation is welcome!
