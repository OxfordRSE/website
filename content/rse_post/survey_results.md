In April 2018 we launched a [short survey](/projects/RSE/rse_post/survey_launched/) to assess the need for Research Software Engineering within the University of Oxford.
On the back of an overwhelmingly positive response to that survey, we have formed an RSE group with initial support from the [EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/internal-research-funding/impact-and-innovation/iaa), and are now open for business.
Please [contact us](mailto:rse@cs.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to discuss a software project.


## Who responded to the survey?
We received 375 responses in total from across a broad spectrum of departments, with roughly 60% from [MPLS](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/) and 30% from [Medical Sciences](https://www.medsci.ox.ac.uk/).

## Do those writing software have the skills they need?

## Commercialisation of research software

Many developers (40% of respondents) want to commercialise their software.
To establish whether software is currently being written of a sufficient quality to be ready for commercialisation, we drilled into this figure.

As many as 70% of academics (lectures and group leaders) whose lab develops their own research software said that they felt comfortable sharing their code with an industrial partner.
However, of those academics, many had not heard of, or were not confident with, unit testing - one of the basic principles of writing robust software.
This indicates to us that a large proportion of academics are overconfident about the quality of software produced in their labs, and that much of the software with commercialisation potential is likely not written to be robust or sustainable enough to translate to a commercial environment.
